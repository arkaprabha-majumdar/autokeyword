0,India vs West Indies: Ishant Sharma one wicket away from surpassing Kapil Dev in elite list,"© Gokul VS/Hindustan Times/Getty India fast-bowler Ishant Sharma is on the verge of adding a fresh feather into his already illustrious cap when he takes to the field against West Indies in the second and final Test of the series at the iconic Kingston Cricket Stadium in Jamaica starting Friday.



Full coverage: India tour of West Indies

India lead the series 1-0 and will look for another good performance when they lock horns against Jason Holder's troops.



As for Ishant, he will be eager to build upon his eight-wicket show in Antigua. Ishant is currently tied with legendary all-rounder Kapil Dev at the second spot in the list of most wickets taken by an Indian outside Asia.

If he manages to take one wicket in the upcoming Test, he will become the sole second place holder in this illustrious list.

Ishant played a pivotal role in India winning the first Test by 318 runs. In the first innings of Antigua Test, the pacer scalped his ninth five-wicket haul in the longest format to break the backbone of Windies batting line-up.

Later, Ishant attributed his good show to pace bowling partner Jasprit Bumrah.



""There was rain and after that the ball became wet and there was nothing happening (with the ball). So, we thought we can bowl with a cross seam. There was bounce. Actually Bumrah told me that we can try cross seam since there is nothing happening,"" Ishant, who returned with figures of 5/42, said.

""The attempt was, if you bowl out the opposition as soon as possible, it is good for your team. We tried that we were able to do that,"" he told fielding coach R Sridhar who interviewed him for bcci.tv.



Jamaica Test will be Team India's final match on the tour and they will be eager to end it on a winning note.

Virat Kohli's troops have been in sensational form against Windies, having won the T20I and ODI series 3-0 and 2-0 respectively. They will now look for similar level of performance in the final contest of the tour.

1,Science Says This One Personality Trait Can Help You Live Up to 15 Percent Longer,"We often talk about the power of positive thinking—and according to new scientific research, positivity may be even more powerful than you think.

The new study, published in the journal PNAS, found that more optimistic people live much—and we mean much—longer.

The researchers at Boston University School of Medicine analyzed the overall physical and emotional health and lifestyle habits of 69,744 women for 10 years and 1,429 men for 30 years.

They found that, accounting for all other factors, the most optimistic people had an 11 to 15 percent longer lifespan on average than their more pessimistic counterparts. What’s more, the optimistic subjects had a 50 to 70 percent greater chance of reaching the age of 85.

© Provided by Best Life If you want to appear more approachable and attractive, start by monitoring your body language. Crossed arms or keeping your hands on your hips can make you seem defensive or angry, but a more casual stance can disabuse others of that impression.

We all knew that a healthy diet and a regular exercise regime are keys to a long life.

But an increasing amount of research shows that healthy aging isn’t just about what you do, it’s also about how you feel. Previous studies on the oldest living people in the world identified four personality traits that they all seemed to have in common: strong family bonds, stubbornness, a strong worth ethic, and, yep, a positive attitude.

And a 2012 study also found a link between optimism and living longer, though further research is needed to determine why that’s the case. Some researchers speculate that it may be that a positive attitude helps people make other healthy choices that affect longevity, such as not smoking and abstaining from alcohol.

“More optimistic people may be able to regulate emotions and behavior as well as bounce back from stressors and difficulties more effectively,” senior study author Laura Kubzansky, PhD, MPH, co-director of the Lee Kum Sheung Center for Health and Happiness at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, said in a press release.

India opened 137 Himalayan peaks to foreigners for mountaineering and trekking expeditions, including the world’s third-highest peak — Kanchenjunga.

These include Mt Kailash (6400m) in Jammu & Kashmir, Hardeol (7151m) in Uttarakhand and Mulkila (6571m) in Himachal Pradesh.

Located at a height of 8,586 metres, Kanchenjunga was first scaled by a British expedition in 1955 but they stopped short of the summit. Since then, no expedition has not climbed the last 10m as the mountain is considered holy and the route was closed by Sikkim govt in 2000.

Of the 137 peaks, 51 are in Uttarakhand, 24 in Sikkim, 15 in Jammu and Kashmir, and 47 in Himachal Pradesh.

However, for carrying satellite phones the expedition teams have to take prior permissions from the department of telecommunication, the home ministry said, adding that all information gathered have to be shared with locals formations.

However, many residents of Sikkim are unhappy with the decision.

Kunzang Gyatso, an Everester, told News 18,

“Religion is a priority in many places. And being a mountaineer, I feel that the way we challenge nature, we must also respect it. Sikkim has been built with the blessings of the mountain gods. If you want to climb the Kanchenjunga, you can do so from the Nepal side. In Sikkim, according to religious beliefs, we leave a gap of 10m from the top for any peak, and that becomes our summit.”

Gold and silver prices in India were firm today, hovering around record highs. On MCX, October gold futures prices were up 0.22% to ₹39,251 per 10 grams, after hitting a new high of ₹39,340 earlier this week.

Silver futures on MCX rose 0.42% to ₹46,841 per kg, after hitting a life-time of ₹46,925 in yesterday's session. A weaker rupee and a global rally in both gold and silver prices have lifted the precious metals to record highs in Indian markets.

In global markets, gold remained supported over $1,540 per ounce, near six-year highs of $1,556 set earlier in the week.

Meanwhile, silver prices extended their recent gains, rising 0.85% to a near two-year high of $18.32 per ounce.

Global recession worries fueled by escalating US-China trade tensions and the spectre of a no-deal Brexit have boosted the safe-haven appeal of gold this year, pushing the price of the yellow metal up nearly 20% so far this year. Along with that the turmoil in global financial markets - volatility in equity markets and currency markets and multi-year low bond yields have led investors to pile into gold ETFs.

Current gold-backed ETF holding of about 2,450 tons are about 1,000 tons higher than the post financial crisis low of 1,425.1 tons, says a recent Bloomberg report.

""Comex gold trades in a narrow range near $1545 per ounce. Gold has turned choppy after failing to breach the 6-year high tested earlier this week. Mixed trade in equity markets and US dollar has also led to choppiness in gold,"" Kotak Securities said in a note.

Gold is also supported by continuing investor inflows into gold-backed ETFs, it added.

Analysts also say that gold-buying by many central banks across the world have also supported the prices as the financial institutions seek to diversify their holding.

The second reading of Q2 US GDP is due today. If the GDP growth confirms slowdown in economic activity, it could pressurize US dollar which will be supportive for commodities at large, including gold, Kotak said.

US Federal Reserve last month cut interest rates for the first time in about a decade and analysts expect the US central bank to lower rates again next month. Lower interest rates boost the appeal of non-interest yielding assets like gold.

8,India vs South Africa: MS Dhoni unavailable for T20I series,"© Photo by Action Foto Sport/NurPhoto via Getty Images

Former India captain MS Dhoni will not be available to play in the three T20 matches against South Africa at home starting September 15th.

This has been confirmed to India Today by sources close to Dhoni. ""He won't be available to play these games,"" a source said.

The Indian team for the upcoming series against South Africa for both T20 and Test series is due to be picked in the first week of September.

A report quoting sources close to selection committee said the selectors would largely stick to the T20 team that did well in West Indies and Dhoni won't be picked. The selection committee can safety avoid the Dhoni question for now.

Dhoni has been out of action for the past month-and-a-half after the World Cup during which he also did a fifteen day stint with Indian territorial army in his capacity of Hon Lieutenant colonel. Dhoni is currently in USA for a Chennai Super Kings event.

In Dhoni's absence, Rishabh Pant donned the gloves in both ODIs as well the T20I matches and in the first Test against West Indies. Pant appeares the best suited to take over from Dhoni in the long run but the two-time World Cup-winning captain is yet to take a call on his future.

India's next white-ball assignment will be in November when Bangladesh come home for three T20I matches. Selectors will ultimately have to take a big judgement call on Dhoni's future, if he decides to have another crack at the next T20 World Cup scheduled in October, 2020.

Dhoni's first India captain Sourav Ganguly had earlier told India Today that Mahi should continue to play only if he is confident he can play like Dhoni of old. ""MS (Dhoni) is at a stage in his career where he has to take a decision what can I do ahead, can I contribute in the future, can I take India to victory like M.S. Dhoni, not someone else,"" he said.

11,8 Clever Uses for Coconut Oil (That Are Almost Too Good to Be True),"© Getty Images

It’s basically the Instant Pot of ingredients.

It’s no secret that coconut oil is incredibly popular right now, and for good reason.

This versatile ingredient has endless functionality—you can use coconut oil for everything from cooking and cleaning to fighting frizz, less-than-fresh breath, and inflammation. Its delicious flavor, natural ability to moisturize, and anti-bacterial benefits make it useful for almost every room in your house.

Here are the top eight ways you should start putting your jar of coconut oil to work today.

Frying foods at high heat

First things first, we’d like to clear the air on the whole health-halo thing. Coconut oil has plenty of potential health benefits (keep reading!), but it’s important to keep in mind that coconut oil has an extremely high saturated fat content—about 87 percent of its fat content is saturated. If you don’t believe me, just think about the fact that it’s solid at room temperature. Sorry to burst your bubble.

That being said, the saturated fat content makes coconut oil an excellent ingredient for high-heat searing, sautéing, or frying. Why? Because, unlike the polyunsaturated fatty acids found in vegetable oils, it retains its structure at high temperatures. You won't taste the coconut on your steak either—promise.

Homemade magic shell



Would I lie to you? Seriously—just melt coconut oil with chocolate in the microwave and let the mixture cool to room temp before drizzling over ice cream. Give it a minute to set, then crack it open with a spoon. So satisfying!

Fresher breath

Coconut oil has powerful anti-bacterial and antifungal properties, which means it may help fight bad breath and gingivitis. One study showed that swishing with coconut oil (aka oil pulling) for 10 minutes reduced bacteria in the mouth as well as antiseptic mouthwash; another found that daily coconut gargling can reduce inflammation and plaque in participants with gingivitis.

Moisturizing skin

Thanks to its fatty acids, coconut oil is very moisturizing, and it’s safe to use on your body and face for all skin types. It absorbs quickly and gives off a more glowy, dewy effect compared to traditional lotion. The pleasant tropical scent doesn’t hurt, either—you’ll be using it as lip balm before you know it! Keep in mind, coconut oil is comedogenic, so it's not recommended for acne-prone skin.

Stain removal



Combine equal parts coconut oil and baking soda and mix them together to form a paste. Apply to your stained fabric or furniture, wait five or so minutes, and it should wipe away.

Makeup remover

It’s true! Even waterproof makeup can’t stand up to coconut oil. Apply it directly to your skin, or use a cotton pad and let it sit for several seconds, and watch your makeup melt away. Just don’t get it in your eyes, please.

Frizz fighting

Indeed, you can use a small amount of coconut oil over your hair to tame flyaways in humid weather. Simply rub it between your hands to heat it up before delicately smoothing it over strands. It helps lock in moisture and boost shine, too.

Skin irritation and eczema relief

Thanks to its anti-bacterial and moisturizing nature, studies have shown that coconut oil may help with the skin conditions dermatitis and eczema.

BEFORE AUGUST 5, far from the noise of the street outside, the Sher-e-Kashmir International Conference Centre here was an oasis of calm. Built by Jammu and Kashmir’s political establishment and connected to the Centaur Hotel, a high wall and a tight security ring fenced off lush manicured lawns that played venue to many a conference and concert.

Full coverage: Kashmir turmoil

Today, it’s a “subsidiary jail”, its Reception lobby doubles up as the meeting area of a prison. Centaur is where almost the entire top rung of Kashmir’s mainstream is detained. Only close relatives are allowed but not before they have applied to a Deputy Superintendent of Police.

Like the over 50 men detained, their relatives — wives, children, mothers, sisters and parents — are all former VIPs. Until recently, their faces and names were a free pass through any official door in Kashmir. Today, they are frisked, questioned, allowed entry only after depositing everything — from handbags and phones to even sunglasses.

After extensive interviews with officials and relatives of those detained, The Indian Express has pieced together details from inside — an account of how the once political elite is now detained, their security personnel now prison guards and how they feel pushed against the wall in ways more than one.

“We never even imagined such an experience. This is not a real jail but I can fully understand how difficult it is to have a loved one inside a jail,’’ said a relative who spoke on the condition of anonymity. “If you even mention my gender and relationship with the detainee, that can add to our hassle. They can refuse visitation rights. Who knows they may even shift them out? At least, he is here in Kashmir and we can go see him.”

A detainee’s relative said that for the first week, the administration didn’t allow detainees to meet each other. “At the most, they met, briefly, at mealtime because it was difficult to serve meals to so many people separately. It was difficult because other than a few, no one among the detainees has had any experience of incarceration.”

A senior leader who is detained threatened a hunger strike, a source said. “That helped,’’ a relative said. “We are now allowed to spend more time inside.”

Among those in Centaur sub-jail are dozens of former legislators, ministers and leaders of almost all the mainstream parties of Kashmir. Except the detained three former Chief Ministers, almost every mainstream politician is detained here.

“It’s a little better than a real jail. Each one has been allowed a helper. The detainees look relatively more settled but there’s restlessness as the new reality sinks in,” said the relative. “When I visited, I didn’t see any senior leaders of the NC in the meeting place. There were few junior ones though. I heard Sagar Sahib (former minister and senior NC leader Ali Mohammad Sagar) is not keeping well. There were several people talking to Sajjad Lone in a corner. I saw Waheed Para (of PDP) sitting with his family members. He was dishevelled, I couldn’t recognise him first,’’ the relative said.

Another relative who has also visited the sub-jail several times in the last week said that the government is “constantly approaching” the detainees asking them to join the new arrangement. “They prepared a document, a sort of a bond, which they wanted them (detainees) to sign so that they could be released. They want an assurance they won’t carry out any political activity, not speak against the government move, and in a way, stay indoors. I was told nobody has agreed to sign it”.

“Each one of them (detainees) has two options,” said the relative. “One is to resist; it will give legitimacy and izzat (respect) among people but the risk is too high, we will be treated worse than the separatists. Who knows whether it would be safe without security? The other option is to wait it out, see what happens.”

Another relative of a detainee says the sense is that nobody wants to come out. “That’s why nobody is approaching the court against the detention, not even the former CMs (Chief Ministers). I spoke to several of them (detainees), they are extremely worried because they aren’t able to find a simple way out of this…One leader, an experienced politician, told me there are very limited options and each one is very, very difficult. They are aware that the decision they take will have far-reaching implications not only for them but will affect their families, too.”

The relative added: “There is a lot of suspicion. I think apart from few, they talk among their own groups. They are yet to cut across party lines. Everybody is waiting to see who will break away first.”

The administration has neither withdrawn the detainees’ government residences nor their security cover. Sources said one reason could be that the administration is also weighing its options, waiting for the leaders to decide. “The focus is more on second rung and a few well-known ones. I don’t think New Delhi is interested to rope in the former CMs, especially the two Abdullahs and Mufti. That will harm their narrative that this is the end of dynasty rule. I don’t think Sajjad Lone will accept this arrangement, either,’’ a source said.

“Until now, nobody seems to bite the bait. It is going to be a long drawn battle and there will be lot of covert and overt stuff in the months to come. The downgrade of the state could also be deliberate so that statehood and not special status becomes the bargaining chip if things go south.”

There are complaints of pressure to fall in line. Said one relative of a detainee: “My (relative) has decided he won’t join the new arrangement. They have been working on him for days, sending officers who come for a chat…it’s a nightmare for the entire family, especially for children. He is firm not to join but he isn’t sure what to do next. I think some would prefer to leave the country because the cost of staying here and taking either route is so high,” he said.

The arrests of mainstream political leaders began hours before the Centre abrogated J&K’s special status, bifurcated the state and downgraded it to Union Territories on August 5. But much before that, separatists were picked up, their leadership is in jails outside the state.

Many young men picked up for participating in protests or the possibility of joining protests were ferried to jails outside J&K in special aircraft.

© Provided by IE Online Media Services Pvt Ltd The apex court is hearing a plea filed by Chidambaram who has challenged the August 20 verdict of the Delhi High Court denying him anticipatory bail in the INX Media corruption and money laundering cases lodged by the CBI and ED.

The court also asked the ED to submit the documents in a sealed cover.

Full coverage: INX media case

The former Union minister offered before the bench to remain in the custody of CBI till Monday. The apex court refused to comment on it after solicitor general Tushar Mehta said that extension of remand can only be done before the CBI court.

During hearing in the case, ED called the offence of money laundering an act against ""society and nation"" and sought Chidambaram’s custodial interrogation in the INX media case under PMLA.

Mehta, appearing for ED, told the bench of Justices R Banumathi and A S Bopanna that it cannot show the material collected during the probe at this stage as the evidence related to the money trail might be erased.

Mehta said there was no requirement of ""exposing the materials, sources and evidence to the accused at the stage of pre-arrest bail"" and investigation is the exclusive domain of the probe agency, PTI reported.

""Money laundering is an offence against the society and the nation and probe agency has a right and duty to unearth the entire conspiracy,"" Mehta said.

Adding that the ED wanted to interrogate Chidambaram in custody and without the ""protective umbrella"" of anticipatory bail, Mehta said, ""I have materials to show that laundering of money continued after 2009 and even today (in the INX Media case).""

Mehta claimed that the proposal made by Kapil Sibal about the court scrutinising whether an accused has been evasive after examining the questions and answers put to him based on evidence collected is absurd.

Listing out various sensitive and high profile cases being probed under the PMLA, Mehta said the SC decision would have wide ramifications on cases filed against Vijay Mallya, Nirav Modi, Mehul Choksi, Zakir Naik and other terror funding cases.

The probe agency had on Wednesday told the top court that the former minister was ""playing victim card"" and added that there was no ""witch hunt"" against him.

Referring to the arguments advanced by Chidambaram’s counsel on Tuesday that ED wanted to humiliate him by arresting him, Mehta had said, ""A victim card is sought to be played. They are saying humiliation. It is not. It is prevention, prevention and prevention with capital P. I am serious about this"".

Referring to provisions of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA), Mehta had said it provides that material collected during the probe is sent to adjudicating authority in a sealed cover.

To this, senior advocate Kapil Sibal, representing Chidambaram, responded saying they never argued that they wanted access to the material collected by the ED but only said that the agency should put it to the accused and question him on it.

Chidambaram is presently in CBI custody till August 30 with regards to the corruption case linked to INX Media. CBI had lodged an FIR on May 15, 2017, alleging irregularities in Foreign Investment Promotion Board (FIPB) clearance granted to INX Media group for receiving overseas funds of Rs 305 crore in 2007 during Chidambaram’s tenure as finance minister.

Continuing with his tough talk, Union Defence Minister Rajnath Singh on Thursday said that Pakistan has no locus standi on Kashmir and that “no country is backing it on the current issue”.

Singh’s comments come in the wake of Islamabad trying to internationalise the Centre’s move to abrogate provisions of Article 370.

Addressing a Defence Research and Development Organisation event in Leh, Rajnath Singh questioned why Pakistan keeps crying over Kashmir when it never belonged to the country.

""I want to ask Pakistan, when did Kashmir ever belong to Pakistan that you keep crying about it,"" he said.

“Kashmir has always been a part of India,” he said, reiterating the Government’s stand.

“Pakistan ban gaya toh hum aapke wajood ka samman karte hain (Since Pakistan was created, we respect its identity),” he said.

Singh further asked how can India talk to Pakistan when it keeps trying to destabilise India using terror.

India wants to have a good neighbourly relationship with Pakistan, but it should first stop exporting terror to India, he said asserting that Pakistan has no locus standi on Kashmir.

This is Singh’s first visit to Ladakh after it was carved out as a union territory from the state of Jammu and Kashmir.

The Defence Minister further said that Pakistan should focus on addressing human rights violations and atrocities in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir.

He said that US Defense Secretary Mark Esper during a telephonic conversation told him that abrogation of provisions of Article 370 was an internal matter of India.

A spokesperson of the Defence Ministry in New Delhi had said that Esper appreciated the central government’s position that the recent developments in Jammu and Kashmir are an internal matter of India and he hoped that any issue between India and Pakistan would be resolved bilaterally.

Pakistan has been trying to gain global attention by raising the Kashmir issue at the United Nations.

Rajnath Singh had last week said that should bilateral talks happen, it would not be about Jammu and Kashmir, but on Pakistan-occupied Kashmir, the territory under Pakistan’s control since it invaded the region in 1947.

Earlier, he had made an intriguing statement saying that India’s nuclear policy till date has been ‘No First Use’ but “what happens in future depends on the circumstances”.

On August 5, the Government scrapped Article 370 of the Constitution and split the state into two union territories.

A day after the Indian government abrogated Article 370, Imran Khan had warned of “Pulwama-like incidents to happen again”.

India on Thursday hit out at Pakistan for its unwarranted statements on Jammu and Kashmir and said they were nothing but “lies and deceit”. New Delhi said that Kashmir is an internal matter and Pakistan’s statements were “highly irresponsible”.

Full coverage: Kashmir turmoil

“We strongly condemn the recent statements by Pakistani leadership on matters internal to India. These are very irresponsible statements,”said MEA spokesperson Raveesh Kumar.

Imran Khan and his ministers have been consistently targeting India after the government decided to nullify Article 370 ending the special status for Jammu and Kashmir. “The provocative statements from Pakistan include call for jihad and inciting violence in India,” MEA’s Raveesh Kumar said.

Responding to an alert by intelligence agencies that a group of armed men, possibly Pakistan-trained commandos, is feared to have entered Gujarat’s Kutch area, India said Pakistan must start behaving as a normal neighbour. “It is important for them (Pakistan) to now start behaving like a normal neighbour. What do normal neighbours do? You don’t push terrorists into a neighbouring country. You do normal talk, normal trade. This is not something which is happening from Pakistan,” Kumar said.

On Pakistan’s letter to the United Nations alleging human rights violations in Jammu and Kashmir, the external affairs ministry said “the letter is not even worth the paper on which it was written. Don’t want to give credence to it by reacting”.

New Delhi’s comments come amid rising tensions between the two neighbours and on a day Pakistan test-fired its surface to surface missile Ghaznavi.The timing of the missile launch is seen as part of an effort by Pakistan to internationalise the Kashmir issue at both military and diplomatic levels. It also raises the spectre of nuclear war between the two countries.

Pakistan has also been threatening to close its airspace to India. But there seems to be different voices within the Imran Khan regime over the issue. Science and Technology Minister Fawad Chaudhry tweeted on Tuesday that the government was considering complete closure of airspace to India but foreign minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi said no such decision has been taken yet.

20,Major relief for taxpayers between Rs 5 lakh and Rs 10 lakh likely as Panel proposes new slab,"© AP

Taxpayers earning between Rs 5 lakh and Rs 10 lakh a year may be in line for major tax relief with the task force on the Direct Tax Code suggesting halving the tax rate for them to 10%, two persons aware of the matter said on condition of anonymity.

To be sure, this is still just a suggestion and it is not clear whether the government, which is very focused on increasing its tax revenue, will accept it.

The task force submitted its report last week and recommended that the government increase the number of tax slabs or tax brackets from four to five, but lower the tax rates for many.

There is no change in the first income-tax slab (up to Rs 2.5 lakh a year), which attracts zero tax. The current second slab (Rs 2.5 lakh to Rs 5 lakh) attracts 5% tax. The task force wants to expand this slab (Rs 2.5 lakh to Rs 10 lakh) and have a 10% tax rate, while retaining the available full tax rebate for those earning up to Rs 5 lakh.

“Effectively, people having income up to Rs 5 lakh will have to pay zero tax. Tax will be charged for income between Rs 5 lakh and Rs 10 lakh at 10% and an individual can save up to about Rs 37,500 a year (at the higher end) under the proposed regime,” one of the persons cited above said.

Currently, people earning between Rs 5 lakh and Rs 10 lakh are taxed at the rate of 20%. The proposed third slab (Rs 10 lakh to Rs 20 lakh ) will attract a tax of 20%; it is expected to give a benefit of about Rs 1 lakh to the taxpayer if his or her income is on the upper side, the first person said. People in this slab currently pay 30% (the current slab is Rs 10 lakh and above).

The panel has proposed a fourth tax slab of Rs 20 lakh to Rs 2 crore that will attract a tax rate of 30% and the fifth slab, Rs 2 crore and above, will attract a rate of 35%. Under the current regime, the rate is 30% for people whose incomes fall in these slabs. If the proposal of the committee is accepted, a person earning Rs 2 crore will save around Rs 8.5 lakh.

This is, of course, assuming that there are no surcharges on tax. Currently, for instance, people whose incomes fall in the higher tax slabs pay surcharge.

The Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) did not respond to queries. A government official said on condition of anonymity that the report presented by the task force is yet to be evaluated and that it isn’t necessary to accept all recommendations.

The government constituted the task force on the Direct Tax Code in November 2017 to review the existing income-tax legislation and to draft a new direct tax law in consonance with economic needs of the country. “The recommendations have something for every taxpayer. But, exact benefits can be calculated after one is clear whether the panel proposed to remove cess and surcharge or not,” chartered accountant Jitendra Chhabra said. Currently, with surcharges and cess, a person earning over Rs 2.5 crore pays tax at an effective rate of 42.7%.

“Even if there is a small reduction, it will put more money in the individual’s pocket. I guess it will push aggregate demand. This will push up production and can act as the much needed boost for the economy. But this is only one aspect as there are other encouraging news too,” said Sanjay Kumar, senior director, Deloitte Haskins & Sells LLP.

“Overall, the personal tax collections will be down by Rs 50,000 crore or thereabout only on the rate reduction. But the personal income tax is very buoyant at present, and so with growth in economy that gap in tax will be easily filled. Also, the rate reduction will have a salutary impact on compliance, and also economic growth—the Laffer curve effect,” he added.

23,"7 Chia Seed Benefits, According to a Nutritionist","Chia seeds have officially transitioned from trendy to mainstream.

You’ll find these tiny oval seeds stocked in regular supermarkets and incorporated into numerous products—from fruit drinks and energy bars to cereals and even tortilla chips.

That's likely because chia seeds are nutrient powerhouses, and they offer some key health benefits.

Here are seven reasons to incorporate them into your meal-planning routine.

Chia seeds are nutrient-rich

In addition to providing healthful fat, plant protein, and fiber, a one ounce portion of chia seeds packs nearly 20% of the daily target for calcium. An essential nutrient for healthy bones, calcium is needed for the proper functioning of muscles, blood vessels, nerves, enzymes, and hormones. Calcium plays a role in blood clotting, blood pressure, and maintaining normal heart rhythm and brain function.

That same portion of chia seeds also has about a third of the daily goal for the minerals magnesium, manganese, and phosphorus. Magnesium helps improve mood and sleep, while manganese plays a role in collagen production and promotes skin and bone health. Phosphorus helps form cell structures and works with calcium to keep bones healthy.

Once ounce of chia seeds also contains smaller amounts of B vitamins, potassium, and zinc. B vitamins help support energy production. Potassium helps maintain heart function, healthy blood pressure, and muscle contractions; prevents muscle cramps; and helps maintain muscle mass. Zinc is required for a number of immune functions, in addition to healing and maintaining appetite.

Chia seeds are high in fiber



Of the 12 grams of carbohydrate in a one ounce portion of chia seeds, an impressive 10 grams come from fiber. That’s 40% of the daily minimum goal for this important nutrient. On top of supporting digestive health, chia fiber helps feed the healthy gut bacteria linked to immunity and positive mood.

That fiber also protects against heart disease by reducing cholesterol and triglycerides (blood fats), increasing “good” HDL cholesterol, lowering blood pressure, and inhibiting blood clots.

Chia seeds are chock full of heart healthy fat

Speaking of heart disease, chia seeds are rich in a type of plant-based omega-3 fatty acid called alpha-linolenic acid, or ALA, tied to anti-inflammation and improved circulation. One study found that consuming 37 grams of chia seeds daily reduced a blood marker for inflammation by 40%. The anti-inflammatory effect also supports skin health, and it plays a further role in protecting the heart.

Chia seeds are loaded with antioxidants



The health-protective antioxidants found in chia seeds are known to defend against oxidative stress. This is essentially an imbalance between the production of cell-damaging free radicals and the body's ability to counter their harmful effects. This protection helps fend off aging and protects the brain, as oxidative stress is a causative factor in diseases like Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s.

Chia seeds are good for bones

As mentioned earlier, these mighty seeds pack several key nutrients tied to bone health, including calcium, magnesium, phosphorus, and manganese. It’s the combination of these minerals, in addition to other nutrients and regular physical activity, that protect bone density. The calcium content of chia seeds also makes them a good source of this important mineral for those who must or prefer to avoid dairy.

Chia seeds help regulate blood sugar levels



Chia seeds help stabilize post-meal blood sugar levels and improve insulin sensitivity, which can translate to steadier, sustained energy. In one study that compared chia to flax seeds, both resulted in lower blood sugar levels, but chia had a greater ability to convert glucose into a slow-release carbohydrate and positively impact satiety. That led to reduced appetite and desire to eat.

Chia seeds support healthy weight loss

Chia seeds support weight loss in a number of ways, including their impact on blood sugar and satiety, as noted above, as well as their anti-inflammatory effect.

One of my favorite chia properties is the gel-like texture they produce when added to liquids, due to their ability to soak up about twelve times their weight in fluid. The thickness this adds to smoothies or juices has been shown to suppress hunger more than thinner versions of beverages with the same calorie levels.

One study that provided volunteers with a mid-morning snack of yogurt with and without chia seeds found that the addition of the seeds resulted in lower post-snack hunger, as well as a decreased desire for sugary foods. It also led them to eat less at lunchtime.

I enjoy whipping up chia “shots” made with 100% juice, and I love adding the seeds to puddings, overnight oats, energy balls, dark chocolate truffles, acai bowls, and smoothies. For the latter, try soaking the seeds in your liquid of choice for at least five to 10 minutes before blending. You can even soak them overnight in the fridge. The thicker texture soaked seeds provide will leave you feeling full, satisfied, and energized for hours.

25,Apple can now aim for a bigger bite of India market as government eases rules,"© Getty

After recording double-digit revenue growth in India for the June quarter, Apple may now gain from the Centre’s move to further relax foreign direct investment in single-brand retail trade (SBRT) for companies looking to invest in India and opening retail stores.

The move will benefit the US-based premium smartphone maker, facing challenging times in the Indian smartphone market amid stiff competition from Chinese companies.

“We love our customers in India and we’re eager to serve them online and in-stores with the same experience and care that Apple customers around the world enjoy. We appreciate the support and hard work by Prime Minister (Narendra) Modi and his team to make this possible and we look forward to one day welcoming customers to India’s first Apple retail store. It will take us sometime to get our plans underway and we’ll have more to announce at a future date,” Apple said in an e-mail to Mint.

Apple has about 1.2% market share in terms of shipments in India where it sells its phones through an estimated 140 retail stores.

The FDI policy currently requires 30% of the value of goods to be procured from India if the SBRT entity has FDI exceeding 51%. Further, as regards the local sourcing requirement, the same can be met as an average during the first five years, and thereafter annually towards the India operations. Companies, however, often reiterated that it was difficult for them to procure goods from India to meet the 30% condition.

(Slideshow by Business Insider)

On Wednesday, the government announced that all procurement made from India by the SBRT entity for that single-brand shall be counted towards local sourcing, irrespective of whether the goods procured are sold in India or exported.

Further, the current cap of considering exports for five years is proposed to be removed. This will allow companies to now include not just locally sold goods but also exports as part of its sourcing. Brands applying for FDI in single-brand retail will also be allowed to commence online retail operations before they open physical stores in a clear indication that the government is closely watching how consumers in India are shifting to online shopping. However, a physical store will need to be opened within two years.

“This is being done to position India as a favourable destination (for foreign brands), that they can make here, sell here and export as well,"" said Navkendar Singh, associate research director, International Data Corp (IDC).

Singh said the step will allow Apple open “destination stores"" in major cities in India and it may get an upper hand in terms of retail, especially because Apple Stores worldwide are known for their experience and the knowledge of its staff.

“Since the average has to pass 30%, brands can go about local procurement gradually,"" says Faisal Kawoosa, founder of techARC. “This helps a brand like Apple."" He also said selling and exporting from India might help the company drive up overall volumes here as well.

IDC’s Singh said that a combination of manufacturing and price drops like it did with the iPhone XR this year, could do good for Apple’s volumes.

Apple has been in talks with officials in India to open its own stores in the world’s fastest-growing smartphone market for quite some time. Local manufacturing would help the Cupertino, California-based company avoid import duties of 20%, and further grow its market share and India revenue.

26,Car underseal: what is it and is it worth doing?,"The bad old days of cars rusting by the time of their first service are thankfully over; but that doesn’t mean modern cars don’t corrode.

In fact, look in any scrapyard and you will see a surprising number of relatively modern vehicles which have succumbed to the MoT tester’s screwdriver. Behind the plastic bumpers and trim, many cars on the road today can be slowly dissolving away. But what can you, as the owner, actually do about the problem of rust? One of the few effective courses of action is to look at car underseal or other rust-proofing measures and below you’ll find our top tips on the different preventative rust treatments available.



Certain car brands have gained a reputation for rust, and they’re not necessarily the ones you’d expect. Pressure to cut production costs can mean car makers skimped on the corrosion protection on the cars when they were built, leading to problems later on.

It can also be a big issue with vehicles which were imported into the UK as used cars, especially from Japan. There, domestic models are not rust proofed extensively as the climate is generally milder and the roads are not treated with corrosive salt in winter.

If you want to preserve your car and ward off the welder, it’s a good idea to invest in some underseal or other rustproofing. This is especially advisable if you live near the sea, regularly drive on rough roads or have had an advisory on an MoT for corroded components. Getting to them earlier will prevent further expensive problems down the road.

Do you need car underseal?

Underseal generally is a tougher paint which is designed to give protection to areas of the car which are not seen everyday, such as the bottom of the car and inside the wheelarches. It is a thick paint which isn’t pretty, but can stand up to being showered which road chippings and debris because it is slightly flexible.

The layer of underseal applied at the factory will become thin and chipped over time however, allowing water and salt to get to bare metal. Moisture or mud can get also get trapped in hidden folds and behind trim such as sill covers. Careless tyre fitters and mechanics can also chip the coating when jacking a car up.

This is when rust will form, and it can quickly become an issue which will make a car uneconomical to repair. Once it has taken hold, small patched welds may get it through an MoT, but unless you have a proper panel replacement it will come back in the future

Car underseal options

There are several different types of treatment, and each has different costs and benefits.

The cheapest form of underseal is a simply a type of bitumen – the same material which is used to hold roads together. It costs around £5 for a small can and is effective at protecting ‘banger’ type cars which you don’t expect to last long term. It doesn’t look pretty though, and make sure you wear gloves and mask off any areas you don’t want to be coated, as it is tricky to remove once applied.

If applied thickly it provides decent protection for a few years, but after a while it will become brittle and crack. This will allow water to meet the metal again and it can even trap the moisture, encouraging rust.

Some mechanics will also apply grease or even old engine oil to components such as brake lines in order to ward off corrosion. This isn’t to be advised, as they can drip off onto the road and cause real issues for cyclists and motorcyclist, as well as causing pollution.

Waxy-type underseals are more expensive, but have the ability to ‘self-heal’ if hit by road debris, which means the panel is always protected. After a few years, though, it can wear away - especially if the underside of the car is regularly pressure washed. In really hot weather it can even melt, leaving some areas with thinner protection.

The best treatments are more expensive but combine corrosion-inhibiting elements and rust converting chemicals in the coating. If the underside of your car is starting to corrode slightly, then these types will treat that at the same time as protecting against further corrosion.

It’s also a good idea to treat the inside of box sections such as chassis rails and sills. A different type of chemical is used for this, or other underseal products can be made thinner with white spirit to make them easier to spray or inject into these inaccessible places.

How to apply underseal

Treating a car is something which can be done by a keen DIYer, but it’s a messy job and you’ll need decent access to the underside. It can be done on ramps or axle stands – just make sure it’s safe before getting under the car and make sure you wear old clothes and eye protection.

To do the job properly you’ll need to make sure the surface to be painted is clean and that the old, cracked underseal is removed. If there are any rust holes, get them repaired now – covering it will only make the welding job more difficult (or impossible) later.

You can either use a paintbrush, aerosol or spray gun to apply the seal. Make sure you mask off areas which shouldn’t be covered – especially the brakes. Protect the exhaust too – although it’s not disastrous if it is coated, the heat will burn the underseal and it will smell unpleasant. It’s also worth covering the paint on panels you will see, as overspray is difficult to remove.

Access to the sills and other enclosed areas can usually be gained by carefully removing a blanking plate or grommet. It there are wheel arch liners or other bits of trim, it is worth dropping them down to access the metal behind. When underneath the car, make sure you spray from different directions to ensure even coverage.

If you don’t fancy doing it yourself, then some garages, bodyshops or specialists will be able to do it for you – expect it to cost between £350-£500. Be sure to go on recommendations though, as it is a tricky job.

Once your car is treated, you can relax knowing you have protection. Remember to keep an eye on it though, and expect to keep the treatment topped up every few years to make sure the rust stays at bay.",,"['different', 'rust', 'road', 'protection', 'underseal', 'doing', 'areas', 'car', 'cars', 'old', 'sure', 'worth']","One of the few effective courses of action is to look at car underseal or other rust-proofing measures and below you’ll find our top tips on the different preventative rust treatments available.

30,How relaxing FDI in single brand retail helps industry,"Replay Video SETTINGS OFF HD HQ SD LO

(Video provided by NDTV)

One of the measures announced by the government today is to further ease FDI norms in single brand retail.

Though 100 per cent FDI was always allowed in single brand retail, the dampener was the clause that they had to mandatorily source from the Indian market. It was this clause which forced Swedish retailer Ikea from not entering the Indian market for a long time.

The government has now eased this norm by allowing single brand retail companies to limit their sourcing in India to just 10 per cent, provided they export 20 per cent of their products to other countries. This would mean consumers who shop for IKEA products outside of India would increasingly come across products with the 'Made in India' tag.

""The export capability from this country will dramatically increase when these retailers start buying for their global requirement,"" says Kumar Rajagopalan, CEO, Retailers Association of India.

The government also allowed single brand retailers to have online only models as opposed to earlier, when they were not a

llowed to have a digital store unless they had a physical presence. This will surely encourage more single brand foreign retailers to enter India. Many global retailers have refrained from entering India due to exorbitant real estate costs.

However, it's not that single brand retailers have not found a way of coming into India. They may not have used the FDI route, but have partnered (through license agreements) with Indian retail conglomerates. Zara partnered with the Tata Group, while Marks & Spencer and Diesel partnered with Reliance Retail. By partnering with Indian companies these retailers don't need to adhere to FDI norms.

So, will the easing of FDI norms mean more retailers would invest in India independently just as H&M and IKEA have? Industry experts say that while it will surely boost FDI in single brand retail, many will continue to prefer partnerships as they don't understand Indian market dynamics.

Despite the current slowdown, global retailers seem to be interested in the India story. The recent indirect investment of Amazon in Future Retail is an example. Will the relaxation of FDI norms actually lead to newer retail investments in India? Watch this space.

31,"Early Saaho reviews praise Prabhas’ performance, call action ‘on par with Hollywood’","A day ahead of its release in India, the first reactions to Saaho have arrived online. Touted as one of the most expensive action films ever produced in the country, the Prabhas and Shraddha Kapoor-starrer is generating mixed early response from those who have seen it in the UAE, where it releases on Thursday.

Deccan Chronicle quoted a distributor, who said that the film relies too heavily on a couple of action sequences. ""There are two elaborate action sequences, each lasting for more than ten minutes. The entire impact of the film hinges on these two action sequences,"" the source said. The action isn't enough to sustain the film, which is bogged down by a poor script. The source added, ""If they are hoping to acquire blockbuster status on the basis of two action scenes then it is worrisome. Audiences expect a lot more than stunts in their movie experience. On the other hand Shankar's dubbed 2.0 became a moneyspinner without a coherent plot merely on the starpower of Rajinikanth and Akshay Kumar.""

To the contrary, a UAE journalist wrote on Twitter that the film has blockbuster written all over it. Umair Sandhu wrote, ""If you are looking high-octane action scenes, sleek visuals, melodious music and if you love masala movies, then Saaho should definitely be your pick for weekend. Prabhas is India Biggest star now.""

#Saaho is a cinematic marvel which has the style as well as the substance.The VFX & Action Stunts is something which has not been watched on Indian screens ever. At the BO, it is a sure shot blockbuster and will set new benchmarks in the days to come. Highly recommended! ⭐⭐⭐⭐ pic.twitter.com/zzM8qPRpfI — Umair Sandhu (@UmairFilms) August 28, 2019

He continued, “Prabhas makes absolutely no mistakes in getting his act together. There’s no denying the fact that he plays the perfect Pan India hero in this film,who can acts effortlessly, fight in style and charm the audiences. Saaho is a definite must watch. Breathtakingly shot with gorgeous cinematography, this edition notches higher than its preceding films in terms of thrills and mostly in terms of soul. You wouldn’t want to miss a defining moment in the history of commercial films of Tollywood.”

Elavenil Valarivan

The 20-year-old shot gold with 251.7 points while Seonaid Mcintosh from Great Britain took the silver with 250.6 points.

With India already having secured the maximum of 2 Olympic quotas in the women's 10m Air Rifle category, the Olympic quota on Wednesday went to Ying-Shin Lin from Chinese Taipei who finished with a bronze.

Elavenil Valarivan had narrowly missed a place on the podium at the ISSF World Cup in Munich wherin she finished 4th in the final.

However, on Wednesday, Elavenil was at her best, pipping senior compatriots Anjum Moudgil and Apurvi Chandela.

While Anjum Moudgil finished sixth in the 8-woman final, Apurvi Chandela missed out on the final berth after finishing 11th in the qualification round.

India has now won three out of the four World Cup gold medals in the women's 10m air this year. Such has been India's supremacy that Mehuli Ghosh, shooting in the non-competition Minimum Qualification Score (MQS) section, shot a 629.1, which could have earned her a final spot as well.

41,Why Do We Crave Carbs?,"Have you eaten three servings of your vegetables today?

© Photo courtesy of Pixabay, public domain

Have you finished your skinless chicken cooked in lemon? Have you taken a bite of your avocados already?

If not yet, this maybe the reason why you are craving for carbohydrates.

“It could be you're not eating enough food in general, or not balancing meals with enough protein, healthy fats, and fiber to stabilize blood sugar. If you have an underlying health condition, that may impact blood sugars or mineral status that might impact cravings on that level,” Mckel Kooienga, R.D. and founder of Nutrition Stripped, said.

So obviously, a lack of a balanced diet with all the food groups like vegetables, fruits, meat and relevant sources chiefly stimulates your carb cravings.

Feeling low on energy or looking for a light meal also signals your desire for more carbs. “So instead of settling for something you don't actually want, like a mediocre roll or subpar cookie, grab something snacky or intensely flavored. I love smoky-flavored almonds, which are crunchy and bold but balanced. Or if it's during dinner, I'll go for cauliflower pieces that are crisp roasted with Parmesan cheese for a burst of umami with red-pepper flake for spice,” Carlene Thomas, R.D. and founder of Carlene, said.

According to Jessica Cording, R.D., health coach and founder of Jessica Cording Nutrition, a healthier carb alternative is one that is rich in fiber, essential vitamins and mineral and protein.

Kooienga, on the other hand, suggested sticking with whole food carbohydrates such as legumes, potatoes, grains, quinoa, fruits, and starchy vegetables.

Cording recommended berries when craving for sweets. “They offer up a lot of fiber (raspberries, for example, contain about 8 grams of fiber per cup) as well as vitamin C and powerful antioxidant compounds like anthocyanins - the pigments that give red, purple, and blue plants that beautiful color,” she added.

When starving for carbs but still want something heart healthy, Cording said to eat sweet potatoes. “One medium sweet potato provides 4 grams of fiber, as well as vitamin A and vitamin C, antioxidant beta-carotene and 13 percent of your daily potassium needs,” she explained.

If you are still craving for carbohydrates despite the several food suggestions, this could be more psychological than physiological. Kooienga proposed to consult with a licensed and credentialed health care provider. “A registered dietitian or psychologist can help support you in exploring root issues and ways to work through them,” she said.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi launched “Fit India Movement” at the Indira Gandhi Indoor Stadium in New Delhi on National Sports Day on Thursday. The programme aims to encourage all citizens to inculcate a culture of fitness.



PM Modi urged people to make fitness a part of their daily routine and raise awareness about it. He said the launch of Fit India was a step towards a healthy India. “On this day a great sportsperson was born, Major Dhyan Chand. He amazed the world with his his fitness, stamina, and hockey stick,” PM Modi said.



All about PM Modi’s Fit India Movement

PM Modi Modi said fitness has been an integral part of our culture. “A few decades back, a normal person would walk 8-10km in a day, do cycling or run. But physical activity has gone down with the advent of technology,” he said.



The Prime Minister also administered a fitness pledge in his address, inviting all Indians to join in.



The Fit India campaign is supported by several national sports icons including World Badminton champion PV Sindhu, sprinter Hima Das along with celebrated wrestlers Bajrang Punia and Sakshi Malik.

“I am taking the pledge, are you guys ready to take the pledge,” PV Sindhu said, in a video released by Sports Authority of India on August 27, encouraging followers to take out some time everyday to keep fit.



The Prime Minister had announced the launch of the campaign during his monthly radio address, “Mann Ki Baat” on August 25 and said he wanted to see his listeners fit and make them “fitness conscious”. He had indicated that the fitness programme will have fixed goals.



Arrangements were made for wide viewing of the launch; University Grants Commission (UGC) has asked affiliated higher educational institutes to make arrangements for live viewing of the event by the students, faculty and staff



Institutes have also been instructed to prepare and implement an institutional fitness plan incorporating sports/exercises/physical activities for fitness, into the daily routine. UGC has also asked institutes to encourage every person to walk 10,000 steps on Thursday.



Union sports minister Kiren Rijiju says the Prime Minister’s initiative was receiving support from all sections of the society. “Tremendous supporters are coming from all sections of the society to participate in the #FitIndiaMovement to be launched by @narendramodi ji on 29th Aug at 10am. Chief Ministers, Corporates and many icons are taking amazing steps to make the programme a grand success.""



Fit India Movement is the latest among several other initiatives by the Prime Minister to promote fitness and health. PM is a well known supporter of Yoga and has in the past attributed his fitness to regular yoga and breathing exercises.



Speaking about his fitness routine in a Google Hangout, the Prime Minsiter had said, “I am equally energetic from morning till night. I guess the secret behind it is yoga and [breathing exercises]. Whenever I feel tired, I just practice deep breathing and that refreshes me again.”



The Prime Minister had also accepted Indian cricket team captain Virat Kohli’s fitness challenge in May 2018 as part of a social media campaign, #HumFitTohIndiaFit and posted a video a month later, of him stretching and doing several yoga poses.



“Here are moments from my morning exercises. Apart from Yoga, I walk on a track inspired by the Panchtatvas or 5 elements of nature - Prithvi, Jal, Agni, Vayu, Aakash. This is extremely refreshing and rejuvenating. I also practice breathing exercises. #HumFitTohIndiaFit,” Modi had tweeted in June in response to Virat Kohli’s challenge.

48,Decoded: Proposed tax slabs and their implications on your income,"© Getty Images

If the major changes proposed to the Income Tax Act, which dates back 58 years, are accepted by the government, taxpayers earning between Rs 5 lakh and Rs10 lakh a year are in for a bonanza with a task force suggesting halving the rate for them.

The task force on the Direct Tax Code was constituted in November 2017 to review the existing income-tax legislation and to draft a new direct tax law in accordance with economic needs of the country. The report was submitted to Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on August 19, but it has not been made public yet.

Here is all you need to know about the new proposals and their implications.

The proposed slabs

*The first income tax slab of income up to Rs 2.5 lakh a year remains unchanged. It attracts zero tax.

* The second slab (Rs 2.5 lakh to Rs 5 lakh) attracts 5% tax. The task force has proposed expanding this slab to include incomes between Rs 2.5 lakh to Rs 10 lakh and have a 10% tax rate, while retaining the available full tax rebate for those earning up to Rs 5 lakh.

* The task force has proposed a third slab (Rs 10 lakh to Rs 20 lakh ) that will attract a tax of 20%.

* The panel has proposed a fourth tax slab of Rs 20 lakh to Rs 2 crore that will attract a tax rate of 30% .

* The proposed fifth slab, Rs 2 crore and above, will attract a rate of 35%.

What this means

*People having income up to Rs 5 lakh will have to pay zero tax.

*Tax will be charged for income between Rs 5 lakh and Rs 10 lakh at 10% and an individual can save up to about Rs 37,500 a year (at the higher end) under the proposed regime.

* The proposed third slab (Rs 10 lakh to Rs 20 lakh ) is expected to give a benefit of about Rs 1 lakh to the taxpayer. Taxpayers in this slab currently pay 30% (the current slab is Rs 10 lakh and above).

* If the proposals are is accepted, a person earning Rs 2 crore will save around Rs 8.5 lakh.

*Final tax rates will depend on whether cess and surcharges will be imposed or not.

* The panel has also recommended removal of dividend distribution tax and scrapping minimum alternate tax.

49,RBI to release annual report for FY19 today. Key things to watch out for,"© Reuters

The Reserve Bank of India is set to release its Annual report for the financial year 2018-19 today. The report, which is released every year, analyses the working and operations of the RBI and suggests measures to improve the economic performance.

Here are the 3 main things to watch out for from the annual report.

RBI’s Balancesheet

The FY19 annual report is significant in the backdrop of the release of the new economic capital framework under which RBI will transfer ₹1.76 trillion surplus to the government. The transfer includes ₹1.23 trillion of surplus for 2018-19 and ₹52,637 crore of excess provisions.

The annual accounts will therefore give a detailed explanation of the reason behind the increase in surplus during the last financial year. In comparison, the central bank had seen a balancesheet increase of 9.49% with overall surplus at ₹50,000 core for the year ended 30 July, 2018. Mint had reported on Wednesday that the transfer of the surplus to RBI is balancesheet neutral as it will not require the central bank to sell assets.

Economic Assessment

The annual report is likely to reiterate RBI’s concerns on the current growth slowdown in the midst of benign inflation. In its last policy RBI had revised GDP growth for FY20 downwards to 6.9% from 7% in the June policy citing weak economic activity and global slowdown. Addressing growth concerns by boosting aggregate demand, especially private investment, assumes the highest priority at this juncture while remaining consistent with the inflation mandate, the central bank had said in the policy.

State of banking system

The annual report is likely to highlight the state of the banking system including non-banking finance companies. In its financial stability report, RBI had said that there is a need for greater surveillance of NBFCs and housing finance companies (HFCs) as the failure of these companies can cause losses comparable to those caused by big banks.

The central bank had conducted stress tests on the NBFC sector and on individual lenders in order to gauge their resilience in an event of three stress scenarios—baseline, medium and severe. The tests showed that under the first two scenarios, around 8% of the companies will not be able to comply with the minimum regulatory capital requirements of 15%.

Around 13% of the companies will not be able to comply with the minimum regulatory capital adequacy norms under the third scenario, the report had said. The report had also observed that the gross non-performing assets ratio of banks may decline to 9% in March 2020 from 9.3% in March 2019.",,"['annual', 'surplus', 'transfer', 'key', 'growth', 'rbi', 'central', 'things', 'watch', 'release', 'bank', 'companies', 'financial', 'today', 'report', 'fy19']","© ReutersThe Reserve Bank of India is set to release its Annual report for the financial year 2018-19 today.

The city of Ollolai, Italy, is currently selling homes for only 1 euro in an attempt to rejuvenate the community, but there’s a catch: Home buyers are required to refurbish the homes within three years, which will cost approximately $25,000, CNN reported.

Although this is still a good deal, there are some cities that actually pay you to live there, with some giving away lots for free and others paying residents to move in. But these incentives almost always come with a catch as well.
